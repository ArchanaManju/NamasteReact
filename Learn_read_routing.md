useeffect --> if no dependicy array , useeffcet is called on evrytime componenet rendered .
if there is empty dependecy array, rendered on intail render of the compoenet.even if the compoenet re render the useffcet is not called 
if we have something inside the dependecy array , usefffect is called everytime the dependent is cahnged the useeffct is called .

Usestate --> never create outside the compoenet .it is used to crate local state variable for that compoenet so it has to be inside that componenet .
do create inside the if else or condation or loop or function -- this will cause inconsistency 
on higher level as first compoenet 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Npm java script libaray react route Dom ~~~~~~~~~~~
carteing aboutus page ===> Header componenet

when ever we create route we create routing configuration in main App.js file 
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

configuartion 
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {  
        path:'/',
        element:<AppLayout /> 
    },
{
    path:'/about',
    element:<About/>
},

])

when we create this config , i need to provide this to config to render .
for that we will use RouterProvide from react-router-dom

before we were rendering applayout directly 
root.render(<AppLayout />);
now we need to provide this to Routerprovider 
root.render(<Routerprovide router={appRoute} />);

~~~~~~~~~~~ Creating child routuer ~~~~~~~~~~~
example if i naviaget to about page . i should still see header componet , and should be see about us page under header .
currently we show header and body in a smae way when we change path header should reatin only body should be changed 

so in <AppLayout>



const AppLayout = () => {
    return (
        <div className="app">   
            <Header />
            // if path / than load 
            <BodyWithApiCall />
            // if path is /about than load
            <About/>
        </div>
    );
}

add all the routes as childer for app laouyt , now we need to load header and path specifi compoenet 
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {  
        path:'/',
        element:<AppLayout />, 
        children:[{path:'/',
        element:<BodyWithApiCall/>},{
    path:'/about',
    element:<About/>
},
{
    path:'/contact',
    element:<Contact/>
},],
        errorElement:<Error/>

    },

])
so no we need to fill in the comppoenet based on the path match , for this we can use function called Outlet Provide by react-dom 
Outlet will check the path and based on the path it will load the childern 
Check file RestaurantsAppApi.js

~~~~~ No we need to link the About us to open the page 
for this in header componet 
<li><a href ='/about'>About </li>
In react when we are routing dont use <a> anchor tag to do the routing 
if we do this that means page is re loading , 

we should not use this as it loads eniter page , we will use Link compoent from recat-dom 
Link will replace respective compoent not realoding eniert dom 

if we go to new route its changing the compoent not loading new page ===> hence react is called single page application , we dont need change the page it reloads the compoent as required.

# Routing in web apps ########
Clinet side routing  and server side routing

-- Server side routing -> we click on about us reloads eniter page sends ntweork call fetch the data and loads the data on to page 

-- Client side routing -> in our application when we clik on about us we are loading teh already exiting compoenet not fetch any data from netwrok .
